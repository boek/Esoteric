## Algorithms

### Bogosort
> In computer science, **bogosort** (also **permutation sort**, **stupid sort**, **slowsort**, **shotgun sort** or **monkey sort**) is a highly ineffective sorting algorithm based on the generate and test paradigm. The algorithm successively generates permutations of its input until it finds one that is sorted. It is not useful for sorting, but may be used for educational purposes, to contrast it with more efficient algorithms.
