Esoteric sorting algorithms.

## Algorithms

### Bogosort
> In computer science, **bogosort** (also **permutation sort**, **stupid sort**, **slowsort**, **shotgun sort** or **monkey sort**) is a highly ineffective sorting algorithm based on the generate and test paradigm. The algorithm successively generates permutations of its input until it finds one that is sorted. It is not useful for sorting, but may be used for educational purposes, to contrast it with more efficient algorithms.

```swift
let sortedArray = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1].sortedByBogosort()
```

### Slowsort
> Slowsort is a sorting algorithm. It is of humorous nature and not useful. It's based on the principle of multiply and surrender, a tongue-in-cheek joke of divide and conquer. It was published in 1986 by Andrei Broder and Jorge Stolfi in their paper Pessimal Algorithms and Simplexity Analysis (a parody of Optimal Algorithms and Complexity Analysis).
